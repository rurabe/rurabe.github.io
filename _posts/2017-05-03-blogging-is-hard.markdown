So, blogging is hard.


More generally, writing is hard. The previous post (2.5 years ago) was meant to shame myself into writing by illustrating just how long the gap was.


Mission accomplished.


I think generally though it's a mismatch between long term and short term incentives. When I'm busy and working, it's hard to justify the time spent wrangling the words into something coherent when other stuff needs to be done. My new plan is to make Wednesday the day for writing. Even if all I write is "I don't have time to write this Wednesday".


We'll see how it goes.
