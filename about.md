Hi, I'm Ryan. I'm a hacker.

I write software for a living. I started out writing Ruby and still write a lot of it, but I felt the winds shifting and now I write a lot of Javascript.

I travel as much as I can, but home base is Honolulu. I generally allow the airline industry to fly me around. I'd love to get a boat and sail around in the near future.

I like talking about economics and politics. I also enjoy funny things like [xkcd](http://xkcd.com) and [dinosaur comics](http://qwantz.com).

Say hello! rurabe at gmail dot com.
