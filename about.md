Hi, I'm Ryan. I'm a hacker.

You know how people back in the day used to be warrior-poets? That appeals to me quite a bit but I can't decide if I would want to be a warrior-coder or coder-poet. Hmm.

I write software for a living for a ticket company, mostly in ruby and javascript.

I travel as much as I can, but home base is New York. I generally allow the airline industry to fly me around. I'd love to get a boat and sail around in the near future.

I like funny things like [xkcd](http://xkcd.com) and [dinosaur comics](http://qwantz.com).

Say hello! rurabe at gmail dot com.
